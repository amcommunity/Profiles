Profiles are sorted by categories to improve experience. Each category has a
folder and a readme file. The readme file describes each file.  If a file is
called `carrier.json`, the readme should be as follows::

  - **carrier.json:** Disables all American carrier apps

How to Contribute
=================
1. **Export profile:** In the profiles page, long click on a profile to export
   it.

3. **Create a pull request or an issue.** Create an issue with the contents of
   the json file along with the purpose of the json file, or clone the
   repository, put the json file under the desired folder (based on package
   name), add/modify the readme file in the format given above (the list should
   be sorted in ascending order) and create a merge request.  If you are unsure
   about the category of the profile, create an issue instead.
